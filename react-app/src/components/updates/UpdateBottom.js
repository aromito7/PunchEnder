                Since our launch in 2009, more than 230,000 projects have been funded on Punchender with the support of over 21 million backers — over seven million of whom have supported more than one project.

                The $7 billion they've pledged has helped creative projects of all kinds come to life, from some of the biggest games in the world to Grammy-winning music projects and Oscar-winning films, to new products and technologies that have become household names.
